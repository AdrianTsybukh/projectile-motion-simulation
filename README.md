# projectile-motion-simulation
#### This is a simple Projectile motion simulation written in C using raylib.

here are some basic controls:
* Hold Left mouse button and drag to launch the ball. Works like a slingshot.
* Hold Right mouse button and drag to draw some more rectangles.
* Press R to clear the rectangles.

You will also need to install raylib and i cant help you with that :) you have to know how to do it yourself.
